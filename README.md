Tasks
Basic Data Structures

1. Function: add_numbers (2 points)
Write a Python function named add_numbers that takes two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns the sum of the two numbers.

2. Function: is_even (2 points)
Write a Python function named is_even that takes a single parameter, number, and returns True if the number is even, and False otherwise.

3. Function: reverse_string (2 points)
Write a Python function named reverse_string that takes a string text as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

4. Function: count_vowels (2 points)
Write a Python function named count_vowels that takes a string text as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

5. Function: calculate_factorial (2 points)
Write a Python function named calculate_factorial that takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

6. Function: apply_decorator (1 point)
Write a Python function named apply_decorator that takes a function func as input and applies a decorator named decorator_func. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.
Sequences

7. Sort List of Tuples (1 point)
Given a list of tuples where each tuple contains a name and an age, write a Python function named sort_by_age that sorts the list of tuples by age in ascending order.
Sets and Dictionaries

8. Merge Dictionaries (1 point)
Write a Python function named merge_dicts that takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.
Object-Oriented Programming

9. Class Creation (2 points)
Define a Python class named Car with the following attributes: make, model, year. Implement a method named display_info that prints out the car's information.
